    <p>For about 150/200 years Bharali Naamghar was situated in the then' Bamgaon',currently known as 'Daulpukhuri'. Bapuram Deo of Balisatra took the initiative in establishing the Naamghar. Sadly, the Naamghar was burnt down by the Burmese Army(during Burmese invasion in Assam between 1817 and 1826). Having no other option the villagers left the place and reestablished the same in Bharali Gaon. Accordingly ,the Naamghar popularly known as Bharali Naamghar.

One of the interesting facts about Bharali Naamghar is the 'Laikhuta'(main pillar of the building) made by Tulsi tree(holy Basil). There are faiths and beliefs about the Laikhuta and preserved well near 'Simhasana' or 'Guruasana'. It is believed that Bharali Naamghar is the holy place to visit for fulfilling wishes. The local senior people used to say that the Naamghar is the rest house of 'Burha Dangoria'(holy sprit).

   <p>Maghi Purnima or Makar Sankranti is an auspicious day. On this day thousands of devotees visit Bharali Naamghar to fulfill their wishes . A lot of devotees come to the Naamghar especially in the sacred month of Bhado (August -September) and Maagh (Januaryâ€“February). Spirituality lies in the sound of Doba and Borkaah(instruments to play during prayer) that removes negative power and welcomes the positive. To perform 'Naam-Prasanga'(communal prayer) and 'Bhaona'(theatrical performance) in Srimanta Sankardeva(Vaishnava guru) Tithi (observatory day) and Shree Shree Madavdeva (Vaishnava guru and disciple of Srimanta Sankardev)Tithi is a tradition in Bharali Naamghar. It is said that if a child is unable to walk in time people offer bamboo stick to the Naamghar ,if someone lost his cow people offer Diya(oil lamp),as a remedy of late marriage devotees visit with Diya and Sarai(raw fruits,Maah -Prasad as offering). Individuals can feel the existence of divine power in the Naamghar.
