    <p>Than’ means a sacred place in Assamese society. Traditionally this word has been used to indicate a sacred place. It was derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Sthan’ meaning place. Srimanta Sankaradeva used this indigenous Assamese word ‘Than’ to indicate the residential religious institution created by him. At that time the word ‘Satra’ was not used. Srimanta Sankaradeva himself used the word ‘Than’. It was only later that the word ‘Sattra’ started to be used.
Batadrava Than in Bordowa in the present Nagaon district of Assam is one of the best known Thans founded by Srimanta Sankaradeva. It is named as SRI SRI BATADRAVA THAN. Srimanta Sankaradeva set up the first ever Kirtanghar here in 1468. The importance of this place is also derived from the fact that the saint was born at Alipukhuri – Bordowa in 1449. After returning from his 12 year long pilgrimage in 1493, he started preaching his Vaishnavite religious ideas here regularly and systematically. His ideas were based on Bhagavata Purana.

Batadrava Than is the first Than or the first institution set up by Srimanta Sankaradeva for propagation of EKA SARANA NAMA DHARMA founded by him. He also built the ‘Monikut’ together with Kirtanghar or Namghar and the ‘Cari-Hati’ (four clusters of quarters) for accommodation of his disciples. This full-fledged Than complex came up in 1509. Simhasana or Guru Asana (altar of God) was placed in the Monikut with the holy scripture ‘Bhagavata’ on it without any idol.
